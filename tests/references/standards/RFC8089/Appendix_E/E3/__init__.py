""" [RFC8089]_ - Appendix E.3. UNC Strings

.. seealso:


   Some usages of the file URI scheme allow UNC filespace selector
   strings [MS-DTYP] to be translated to and from file URIs, either by
   mapping the equivalent segments of the two schemes (hostname to
   authority, sharename+objectnames to path), or by mapping the entire
   UNC string to the path segment of a URI.
