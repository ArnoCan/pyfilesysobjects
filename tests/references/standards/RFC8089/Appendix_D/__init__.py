""" [RFC8089]_ - Appendix D. System-Specific Operations

.. seealso:

   This appendix is not normative. It highlights some observed
   behaviors and provides system-specific guidance for interacting with
   file URIs and paths. This is not an exhaustive list of operating or
   file systems; rather, it is intended to illustrate certain types of
   interactions that might be encountered.
