OS Data
=======
The OS specific data contains the pure OS related data and of services
closely related to the OS, e.g. network and security services.
In real systems the most applications share the OS related directories.
The *filesysobjects* supports the paths to the replated directories.

See `filesysobjects.osdata <osdata.html>`_.
